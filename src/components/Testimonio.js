        <Stylecommitp>Sebastian has been a very committed person in his geek academy training
             process, he has shown sincerity in his strengths in order to acquire the 
             necessary technical knowledge to become software development, I have seen 
             that he has been very committed to each of the activities that have been
              proposed and no matter how small the challenge, it has been assumed in a
               thorough and professional way. I feel that there is clarity 
            in Sebastián's purpose in the geek academy program and that I long for
             more people as is the value of this great opportunity to be linked to work in the ICT sector.</Stylecommitp>

        <Stylecommitp>The student starts with no previous knowledge 
            in the Geek Apprentices course. His effort and dedication 
            is evidenced in his continuous study with the training field 
            and external tools. Thus, successfully completing the 
            apprenticeship course and moving on to the official Frontend
             5 course. In the current course, the same dynamics of 
             hard work, effort and improvement are noted, good disposition
              is shown in the classes and with their peers. These are 
              the results shown up to week 4 (mid-course). 
            Constant work and motivation brings very good results, 
            time will prove right. In week 8 I hope to be filling out 
            this form again and telling the end of the story. : D</Stylecommitp>
